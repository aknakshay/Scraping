# Web Scraping - Olx & Quickr - Second hand marketplaces

Objective: Find and buy a second hand scooter from second hand marketplaces

Problem: There are 100s of product listings and it's difficult to go through all to find the best deal

Solution: 
1. Scrape the entries and plot on tableau/ power BI the data on year vs price.
2. Remove outliers (for example, latest year but really low price) and then find a subsection to explore the listings
